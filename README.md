# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Field

This example demonstrates an error that occurs when attempting to use the `$inc` operator with a string field in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric values; using it with a string field will result in an error.

## Bug
The code attempts to increment a string field using `$inc`. This is incorrect and will lead to an error because `$inc` requires a numeric value.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the field is of the correct type (numeric) before using the `$inc` operator or utilizing an alternative approach to update string fields (e.g., `$set`).
